# A journal recommender tool built on the Directory of Open Access Journals

This is a work in progress. The goal is to create a journal recommender to give journal suggestions based on a draft abstract. It still needs quite a bit of work. Ultimately, the aim is to have a Flask application combined with "serverless" infrastructure for data analysis.

Presented at the 18th Annual CUNY IT Conference. New York, NY. December 5, 2019.

This project is partly supported by a grant of Google Cloud Platform credits.
