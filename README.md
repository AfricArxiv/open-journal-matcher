# A journal recommender tool built on the Directory of Open Access Journals

This is a work in progress. The goal is to create a journal recommender to give journal suggestions based on a draft abstract. Ultimately, it will be a Flask application combined with "serverless" infrastructure for data analysis. Right now, the basic architecture is in place and I am testing prototypes. 

Presented at the 18th Annual CUNY IT Conference. New York, NY. December 5, 2019.
